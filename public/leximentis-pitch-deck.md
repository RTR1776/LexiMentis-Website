## AI-Powered Workers' Compensation Platform

## The Problem: Legal Tech Fragmentation

### Workers' Compensation Attorneys Are Drowning

- **Document Overload**: Attorneys spend 20% of time searching for information buried in hundreds of pages
- **Medical Record Bottlenecks**: Hours spent manually reviewing complex medical documentation
- **Disconnected Point Solutions**: 8-12 different software systems per firm with minimal integration
- **High Tech Costs**: 6-10% of revenue spent on multiple systems with low ROI
- **Limited Tech Adoption**: Only 7% of law firms use AI tools despite clear benefits

> "Small workers' comp firms are caught between unaffordable enterprise systems and inadequate generic tools"
